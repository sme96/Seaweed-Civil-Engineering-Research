- 👋 Hi, I’m @sme96
- 👀 I’m interested in nondestructive evaluation of civil structures and infrastructure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about about acoustoelasticity, ultrasonic guided waves, support vector machines, deep learning, and energy harvesting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which turn the focus of inspection and damage control in structures from a reactive response to a proactive response
- 📫 You can contact via email at sme96@scarletmail.rutgers.edu or on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/said-el-hawwat
